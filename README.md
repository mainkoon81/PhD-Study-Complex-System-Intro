__Systems Theory:__ 
 - Herbert Simons gives us this definition; "A system that can be analyzed into many components having relatively many relations among them, so that the behavior of each component depends on the behavior of others."
 - Jerome Singer tells us; "A system that involves **numerous interacting agents** whose aggregate behaviors are to be understood. **`Such aggregate activity is nonlinear`**, hence it cannot simply be derived from summation of individual components behavior."

Elements are nested inside of subsystems (Multi-dimensional property) and many elements on many different scales with all of these levels affecting each other.

__Nonlinear Systems + Chaos:__
 - Nonlinearity arises from the fact that when we put multiple things together, the result may not necessarily be a simple addition of each element's property in isolation. 
 - We may get a **combined effect** greater/less than the simple sum of each element's property because of their interdependent nature. 
 - Some small change in input value to the system can (via feedback loops) trigger a large sysmetic effect (sensitivity of initial conditions: the central idea of the Chaos theory)

__Network Theory:__
 - The connection density(**degree**) or connection pattern(**position**: How things flow in the network) defines the system as opposed to the element's properties.
