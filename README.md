__The Complex System:__ 
 - Herbert Simons gives us this definition; "A system that can be analyzed into many components having relatively many relations among them, so that the behavior of each component depends on the behavior of others."
 - Jerome Singer tells us; "A system that involves **numerous interacting agents** whose aggregate behaviors are to be understood. **`Such aggregate activity is nonlinear`**, hence it cannot simply be derived from summation of individual components behavior."

Elements are nested inside of subsystems (Multi-dimensional property) and many elements on many different scales with all of these levels affecting each other.
