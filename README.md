## Four concepts to model a Complex System
__1.Systems Theory:__ 
 - Herbert Simons gives us this definition; "A system that can be analyzed into many components having relatively many relations among them, so that the behavior of each component depends on the behavior of others."
 - Jerome Singer tells us; "A system that involves **numerous interacting agents** whose aggregate behaviors are to be understood. **`Such aggregate activity is nonlinear`**, hence it cannot simply be derived from summation of individual components behavior."

-> `Elements are nested inside of subsystems (Multi-dimensional property) and many elements on many different scales with all of these levels affecting each other.`

__2.Nonlinear Systems + Chaos:__
 - Nonlinearity arises from the fact that when we put multiple things together, the result may not necessarily be a simple addition of each element's property in isolation. 
 
-> `Some small change in input value to the **system** can (via feedback loops) trigger a large sysmetic effect that is a **combined effect** greater/less than the simple sum of each element's property because of their interdependent nature.` This is referred to as **sensitivity of initial conditions** which is the central idea of the Chaos theory.

__3.Network Theory:__

-> `The connection density`(**degree**) `or connection pattern`(**position**: How things flow in the network) `defines the **system** as opposed to the element's properties.`

__4.Adaptation + Self Organization:__
 - When a certain degree of **autonomy** that each element has is coupled with the loosened **"top-down centralized mechanism"** for coordinating the whole system, the elements can synchronize their state locally, resulting in the **emergence of the system from the "bottom-up"**.

-> `This is the system of`
  - `Heterogeneity` with high levels of **diversity**!!! such as ..ecosystems...multicultural societies
  - `Being subject to the evolutionary force` of Selection & Replication...which makes an **evolution**!!!
